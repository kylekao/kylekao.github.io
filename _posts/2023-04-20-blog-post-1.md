4/28 Story Telling with Data - Assignment 1, 2, 3, 4
|Assignment 1: Google Search Trends and Fast Fashion|
|:--------------------------------------------------|
|Google Search is the leading search engine with 92% of the global market and 3.5 billion searches every day.\ Google Trends is a free tool which measures consumers’ search keywords. It can be used to understand consumer sentiment or more specifically, craft marketing strategies.\ Reference guide on how to use [Google Trends: ](https://shorturl.at/akNX3)\ For example, in 2022, the top four global searches were:\ 1. Wordle\ 2. India vs. England\ 3. Ukraine\ 4. Queen Elizabeth\ Many of the most popular searches in the US relate to social media or retailers (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Macy’s).\ Interestingly, the Chinese online retailer, Shein is in the top 100. Providing trending styles and low prices, Shein competes with other “fast fashion” retailers such as Zara and H&M. (Sadly, these companies are often criticized for their negative impact on the environment.)|
|===================================================|
|*Your goal: Find data, insights, and a story idea around the popularity of Shein in the US.\ 1. Go to: https://trends.google.com/home\ 2. Enter a search term (Shein) and then, two more comparisons (Zara) and (H&M).\ 3. List 5 queries that you did in your investigations.\ 4. List 5 key insights you discovered.\ 5. Create at least 1 graphic to support one or more of these insights.\ 6. Based on your findings, what is your story idea? Explain in three sentences or less.\ 7. Please use the .twbx and/or Word and PowerPoint file formats to upload a copy of your Tableau file to Canvas Discussion Board Assignment 1.|

|Assignment 2: Data aggregation and Rotten Tomatoes|
|:-------------------------------------------------|
|Data aggregation is a technique that combines and summarizes data from disparate sources.\ Rotten Tomatoes is a leading online aggregator of TV and movie reviews. Their consumer friendly “Tomatometer” ranks content as “fresh” > 60 percent or “rotten” < 60 percent. Few movies achieve the coveted 100% tomatometer score, but notable ones include Pixar’s Toy Story and Akira Kurosawa’s masterpiece, Seven Samurai.|
| (Reference:)[https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/rotten-tomatoes-ratings-system/ ] |
|This Kaggle dataset has two sets of the data. The smaller one, rotten_tomatoes_movies, includes critical and popular ratings, as well as industry specific data such as rating, release date (theatre and streaming), language, distributor, and more.\ The larger one, rotten_tomatoes_movies_reviews, includes all the reviews for each of the movies in the aforementioned file. This is a huge file.\ Imagine that you are a movie studio analyst and you have received this data set. Your boss wants you to analyze the data and see if you can find any indicators that can predict a movie’s box office success. Note: Like all data, you may or may not capture any trends.|
|==================================================|
|*Your goal: Create a plan to analyze the data and provide a summary of your steps.\1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrezaza/clapper-massive-rotten-tomatoes-movies-\ 2. Download the data set: rotten_tomatoes_movies\ (Note: there are two data sets... this is the smaller one.)\ 3. Based on the data, list five ways you could analyze this data.\ 4. Upload this data to Tableau and see if you can conduct this analysis. (There are many empty fields, so you may have difficulty. If so, disregard step 5 and continue to step 6.\ 5. If you can, create graphics that support this analysis.\ 6. If you can’t, highlight your difficulty.\ 7. Please use the .twbx file format and/or Word and PowerPoint file formats to upload a copy of\ your Tableau file to Canvas Discussion Board Assignment 2.|

Assignment 3: Create Your Own Data Visualization
There may be times in business, where you have the autonomy to do your own analysis and data visualization.
For example, perhaps you have a hypothesis you want to test, or maybe you want to dig deeper into some earlier research you’ve encountered.
In this assignment, you can either choose a dataset from Kaggle or another source.

Your goal: Show your skills in analysis and data visualization by creating a Tableau visualization workbook
Create a Tableau visualization workbook consisting of a minimum of three worksheets and three different charts.
1. Locate a new dataset from either Kaggle or other source. Explain the source of your data why did you select it?
2. Choose at least 3 different examples from the following chart types: Bar-in-Bar, Line, Stacked Bar, Tree Maps, Area Charts, Heat map, Gnatt or Pie chart.
3. What interesting data insights did you find? Explain your process of discovering these insights. What questions did you ask of the data?
4. Explain the process you took to develop the visualization and why you selected each specific chart type. Which dimensions and measures did you choose, and why?
5. Who is the best audience for this data and for your insights?
6. Please use the .twbx file format to upload a copy of your Tableau file to Canvas Discussion
Board Assignment 3.

Assignment 4: Create A Tableau Story
Here’s an opportunity to “free form” and show off your Tableau skills.
Your goal: Create a brief story using Tableau Stories.
1. Include 3 different maps: a Symbol map, Filled Map and a Density Map.
2. Use annotations (commentary) on each map to describe how to interpret your visualizations
and tell your story.
3. Explain the process you took to develop the maps and what questions they were designed to
answer.
4. Provide a written description in the discussion post. Explain why the dataset was selected,
how each of the maps were created, and what questions the maps are answering.
5. Upload your Story (.twbx) and post your description to the Assignment 4 Discussion Board.

Data Story I: Create and Present Your Own Research (Individual Project – 15%)
Direct to consumer (D2C) is a business model that promotes products and services directly to consumers. This model has been around since the advent of the internet, and gained traction during the pandemic, as consumers relied on delivery for a wider range of services and products. Notable D2C companies include Blue Apron, Casper, Dollar Shave Club, and Warby Parker.
Imagine that you are creating a new D2C business and you want to use consumer research to gauge interest in your offering. These insights will be part of your “pitch deck” to a venture capitalist, so you can get funding for your idea.
Reference: https://mailchimp.com/resources/what-is-pitch-deck/
For this assignment you will create a survey using Qualtrics and distribute to other students in our class. You can choose one of three businesses that all have an organic component.
Note: the examples below don’t have those organic or eco-friendly components.
1. Organic meal delivery service (e.g., Hello Fresh)
2. Organic dog food meal service (e.g., The Farmers’ Dog) 3. Organic cotton socks and underwear (e.g., Bombas)
For this assignment you will create, field, and develop a presentation of 10 pages that incorporates your survey data.
(Note: This presentation doesn’t have to be the pitch deck, just a summary of data that supports your idea.)

Your goal: Create a compelling story that will excite investors in your business idea.
1. Create a survey in Qualtrics (must include 3 different question types, skip logic, piped text and required responses for all questions)
2. Create in either Tableau or PowerPoint, 5 charts that highlight consumer sentiment in the product
3. Create a 10-page PowerPoint deck (which will include those 5 charts) and also highlights: ▪ Business opportunity
▪ Target market and opportunity ▪ Target audience
▪ Solution
▪ Marketing, sales, or promotions
4. Make sure to upload as a PPT and PDF.


Data Story II: Written Communications (Individual Project – 15%)

While PowerPoint is the standard in business communications, not every company relies on a “deck” to communicate or deliver findings.
Most famously, Amazon is known for its six-page memos, which are structured documents which include sections such as:
- Executive Summary
- Background and Context of the Issue
- Goal and Objectives
- Analysis and Research Findings - Recommendations
Other companies such as Google rely on OKR (Objectives and Key Results). References: https://shorturl.at/psxyR,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR
For this assignment, imagine that you are employed at a large integrated healthcare organization in a major metropolitan area (e.g., Kaiser Permanente, UCSF, Stanford Health).
A nonprofit has donated $100 million dollars to your organization to pursue one specific healthcare initiative (e.g., primary care, Covid, mental health, cancer, diabetes, pediatrics, women’s health, or another of your choice).
Your goal is to present a written document (~5 pages) to the management of your organization that makes the best case for one of these initiatives.

Goal: Write a structured memo using data and statistics to make your case.
1. The report should include the following sections: o Executive summary (~2-3 paragraphs)
o Background
o Goal: (Fund $100 million for [initiatives]
o Research findings to support the need for [initiative] (make sure to include at least 5 data points)
o Summarization of recommendations
Note: In this case you can use existing healthcare and public policy research.
Some good sources are: Kaiser Family Foundation and Pew Research Organization.
Their graphs and tables from these sites are generally well designed, so feel free to download and use, but make sure to note the source.
Additionally, while it may be tempting to use ChatGPT, please don’t use it for this assignment!

Data Story III: Persuade the Audience- 2 Minute Exercise (Individual Project= 15%)
In business, we often think of data being used to spur expansion and growth, but sadly, data stories are often told to showcase the decline of a company or brand.
For this assignment you will use existing research (e.g., news articles, syndicated research, social media, annual reports) to prove the following are bad business decisions.
Your target audience and setting: The shareholders of their respective companies and its annual meeting.
1. Elon Musk purchasing Twitter
2. Mark Zuckerberg pursuing the metaverse
In this case, you want to use no more than 5 data points to make your case and present it in 2 minutes or less, using any means of presentation (e.g., Tableau, PowerPoint, Video).
You will be presenting in class (May 5) and your classmates will be evaluating and voting on each presentation.

Goal: Create a persuasive story in 2 minutes or less, with a target audience of shareholders.
1. Using existing online research and up to five data points, create a compelling argument around why either one of these was a bad idea.
2. You can use the visual and auditory mediums of your choice, but make sure that you have at least two points (e.g., numbers, currency, graphics, quotes) visualized in your presentation.
