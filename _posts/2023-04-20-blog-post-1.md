|Assignment 1: Google Search Trends and Fast Fashion|
|:-----------:|
|Google Search is the leading search engine with 92% of the global market and 3.5 billion searches every day.|
|Google Trends is a free tool which measures consumers’ search keywords. It can be used to understand consumer sentiment or more specifically, craft marketing strategies.|
|Reference guide on how to use [Google Trends: ](https://shorturl.at/akNX3)|
|For example, in 2022, the top four global searches were:|
|1. Wordle|
|2. India vs. England|
|3. Ukraine|
|4. Queen Elizabeth|
|Many of the most popular searches in the US relate to social media or retailers (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Macy’s).|
|Interestingly, the Chinese online retailer, Shein is in the top 100. Providing trending styles and low prices, Shein competes with other “fast fashion” retailers such as Zara and H&M. (Sadly, these companies are often criticized for their negative impact on the environment.)|

*Your goal: Find data, insights, and a story idea around the popularity of Shein in the US.
1. Go to: https://trends.google.com/home
2. Enter a search term (Shein) and then, two more comparisons (Zara) and (H&M).
3. List 5 queries that you did in your investigations.
4. List 5 key insights you discovered.
5. Create at least 1 graphic to support one or more of these insights.
6. Based on your findings, what is your story idea? Explain in three sentences or less.
7. Please use the .twbx and/or Word and PowerPoint file formats to upload a copy of your
Tableau file to Canvas Discussion Board Assignment 1.
