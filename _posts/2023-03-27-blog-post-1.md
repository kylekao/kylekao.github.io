# Didfference of Markdown, R markdown

R Markdown
R Markdown is based on markdown:

Markdown (markup language)
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md.

Like other markup languages like HTML and Latex, it is completely independent from R.

There is no clearly defined Markdown standard. This has led to fragmentation as different vendors write their own variants of the language to correct flaws or add missing features.

Markdown (R package)
markdown is an R package which converts .Rmd files into HTML. It is the predecessor of rmarkdown, which offers much more functionality. It is no longer recommended for use.

R Markdown (markup language)
R Markdown is an extension of the markdown syntax. R Markdown files are plain text files that typically have the file extension .Rmd. They are written using an extension of markdown syntax that enables R code to be embedded in them in a way which can later be executed.

Because they are expected to be processed by the rmarkdown package, it is possible to use Pandoc markdown syntax as part of a R markdown file. This is an extension to the original markdown syntax that provides additional functionality like raw HTML/Latex and tables.

R Markdown (package)
The R package rmarkdown is a library which proceses and converts .Rmd files into a number of different formats.

The core function is rmarkdown::render which stands on the shoulders of pandoc. This function 'renders the input file to the specified output format using pandoc. If the input requires knitting then knitr::knit is called prior to pandoc.

The RMarkdown package's aim is simply to provide reasonably good defaults and an R-friendly interface to customize Pandoc options..

The YAML metadata seen at the top of RMarkdown files is specificially to pass options to rmarkdown::render, to guide the build process.

Note that RMarkdown only deals with markdown syntax. If you want to convert a .Rhtml or a .Rnw file, you should use the convenience functions built into Knitr, such as knitr::knit2html and knitr:knit2pdf
