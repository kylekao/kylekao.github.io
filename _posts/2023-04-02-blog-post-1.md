##### Happened: 2023-03-30 | Sloved: 2023-04-02
##### Problem: 
1. Facing error when installing and library package "conjoint", shows 
```R
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘conjoint’ in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):
 there is no package called ‘robustbase’
```
2. As istalling robustbase package, by aswering `Yes`, the Warning comes out,
```R
Warning in install.packages :
  installation of package ‘robustbase’ had non-zero exit status
```
  
##### Tried:

```R
remove.packages("robustbase")
remove.packages("conjoint")
install.packages("robustbase")
install.packages("conjoint")
```

##### Slolution: Answer `NO` when asking "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)"

```R
> install.packages("robustbase")

  There is a binary version available but the source version is later:
           binary source needs_compilation
robustbase 0.95-0 0.95-1              TRUE

Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel) No
trying URL 'https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.2/robustbase_0.95-0.tgz'
