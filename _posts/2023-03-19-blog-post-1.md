Trying to do something different start from here!

Opinions from ChatGPT:\
Firstly, the website appears to be a personal portfolio site showcasing the work and projects of Kyle Kao. The site has a clean and modern design with a simple layout that is easy to navigate. The use of white space and typography gives the site a professional look and feel.

However, there are some areas where the site could be improved. One area is the lack of a clear call-to-action on the homepage. While the site's purpose is apparent, it could benefit from a more prominent and actionable message or prompt to encourage visitors to explore the site further.

Another area for improvement is the content organization. Currently, the navigation menu links to separate pages for each project, which can lead to an overwhelming number of pages. It may be more effective to create a single portfolio page that showcases all projects in one place, allowing visitors to browse and explore all projects in one place.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more context and information about the projects on the portfolio pages. Visitors may be more engaged if they have a better understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and outcomes.

Finally, it would be helpful to have a contact page or form to enable visitors to get in touch with Kyle for potential work or collaboration opportunities.

Overall, the website has a solid foundation and design but could benefit from some tweaks to improve user experience and engagement.
