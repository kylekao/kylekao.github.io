It is really rare to see a Major League Baaeball player who is over 40 or even 45. It's so intense and competitive in modern Major League.
elderly player don't really need to equipted with high volecity or strong power, their experiences and accuracy can make them still firm standing on the field! For example, one of my favorite player [Bartolo Colon](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/colonba01.shtml), his 4 seams only like 84 MPH or something, some how his accuracy and experience support him stand on the field frimly.
In the beginnig, One of my friend ask me who is the oldest, I thought it would be [Jamie Moyer](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/moyerja01.shtml) in my memory.


The oldest major league baseball player is [Satchel Paige](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/paigesa01.shtml)
But it's kinda interesting that he played his **last game in 1965** at the age of **59 years, 80 days**

[Reference:](aige, at 42, was in 1948 the “oldest rookie in big league history.”) \
